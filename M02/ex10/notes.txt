Proportion : According to the WWW, a proportion of 80/20 is "good" for big datasets (case here).
Same proportion should be kept.

Poynomial features : Every x value could be individually put to polynomial form or not. 
It's a question relative to feature engineering.
Red on stackexchange : 
"By the way, usage of single variable polynomial features in decision tree based algorithms 
sometimes might not have an impact on your performance because these transformations do not 
change the total ordering of the variables if odd-powered and therefore decision boundaries 
might be similar, i.e. x1<x2â†’x1^3<x2^3, so the boundary will be still between the two."

For evaluate models : MSE is mainly use in this set of exercice, and overfitting won't be a 
problem thanks to set creations.

3D modeling : Either use 2 features + target or 3 features and color scheming for target.
For evaluating a precise model, the 3 features and in color distance between true and 
obtained target value.]

In benchmark : Put methodology (models, calculation to obtain them, model representation, ...)
In space_avocado : Best model and it's graphic representation. 

More infos:
- Datas could be normalized
- A linear correlation is probable with prod_distance and time_delivery (because distance 
must increase time_delivery)
- Maybe try to use only one variable at not all of them
- Could be interesting to crossed feature (multiply them)

Goal :
Find best model with variables to use, terms/features/polynomial form to use.
