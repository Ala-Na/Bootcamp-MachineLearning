Some words about the dataset:
• You will work with data from the last Solar System Census.
• The dataset is divided in two files which can be found in the resources folder:
solar_system_census.csv and solar_system_census_planets.csv.
• The first file contains biometric information such as the height, weight, and bone
density of several Solar System citizens.
• The second file contains the homeland of each citizen, indicated by its Space Zipcode
representation (i.e. one number for each planet... :)).

As you should know, Solar citizens come from four registered areas (zipcodes):
• The flying cities of Venus (0),
• United Nations of Earth (1),
• Mars Republic (2),
• The Asteroids’ Belt colonies (3).
You are expected to produce 2 programs that will use Logistic Regression to predict
from which planet each citizen comes from, based on the other variables found in the
census dataset.
