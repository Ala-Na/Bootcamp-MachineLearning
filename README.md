## Purpose
A one week bootcamp to learn machine learning using [Stanford massive open online course on Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/week/1) as main resource.

## Curriculum

### Module05 - Stepping Into Machine Learning

**Get started with some linear algebra and statistics**

> Sum, mean, variance, standard deviation, vectors and matrices operations.  
> Hypothesis, model, regression, loss function.

### Module06 - Univariate Linear Regression

**Implement a method to improve your model's performance: **gradient descent**, and discover the notion of normalization**

> Gradient descent, linear regression, normalization.

### Module07 - Multivariate Linear Regression

**Extend the linear regression to handle more than one features, build polynomial models and detect overfitting**

> Multivariate linear hypothesis, multivariate linear gradient descent, polynomial models.  
> Training and test sets, overfitting.

### Module08 - Logistic Regression

**Discover your first classification algorithm: logistic regression!**

> Logistic hypothesis, logistic gradient descent, logistic regression, multiclass classification.  
> Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix.

### Module09 - Regularization

**Fight overfitting!**

> Regularization, overfitting. Regularized loss function, regularized gradient descent.  
> Regularized linear regression. Regularized logistic regression.


## Libraries used
- Numpy
