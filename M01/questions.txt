1. What is a hypothesis and what is its goal?

Hypothesis, also called function, is a learning algoritm. It's goal is to
predict the results of a training set as close as possible of reality. It can
be use to predict future results.

2. What is the loss function and what does it represent?

Loss function represents the distance between reality and prediction :
It help to determine if a model is good or not.


3. What is Linear Gradient Descent and what does it do? (hint: you have to talk
about J, its gradient and the theta parameters...)

The linear gradient descent is an algorithm which tend to affinate thetas parameters
(or coefficients, or weights) which can be adjusted to make predictions more accurate.
It also calculate the

4. What happens if you choose a learning rate that is too large?

When the learning rate alpha is too big, gradient descent may not occurs or,
less often, make a convergence happen quite slowly.

5. What happens if you choose a very small learning rate, but still a sufficient number
of cycles?

When the learning rate is quite small, it make the convergence happen slowly. 

6. Can you explain MSE and what it measures?
